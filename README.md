# React_v16_SmallDecisionApp
A small React Version 16 decision making app.
A bit like a todo app, but this time users input what they want to opt for and a randomized
option pops up.

### This simple little app used:
##### React version 16
##### yarn
##### webpack
##### sass
##### ES6 classes and arrow functions
##### JSX / Babel
##### Stateless Functional Components and Functional Components 
##### React Modal Component
##### JSON
##### Local Storage

It was created as part of a Udemy React course I'm taking at this time.
